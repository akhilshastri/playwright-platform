Here are some recommendations to enhance the reusability of your Playwright test automation framework:

1. Centralize Test Utilities and Helpers
   Current State:
   Basic test utilities exist in
   testUtils.js
   Some core functionality is in the core package
   Recommendations:
   Create a Shared Test Library: Move common test utilities, page objects, and helper functions to the core package
   Standardize Page Objects: Implement a consistent Page Object Model (POM) pattern
   Utility Functions: Add reusable functions for common actions (e.g., login, navigation, form filling)
2. Improve Test Data Management
   Current State:
   Test data appears to be hardcoded in test files
   Recommendations:
   Externalize Test Data: Move test data to JSON/TypeScript files
   Data Factories: Implement test data factories for generating test data
   Environment Configuration: Support different environments (dev, staging, prod) with separate configs
3. Enhance Test Hooks and Lifecycle
   Current State:
   Basic before and after hooks in test files
   Some global setup in globalSetup
   Recommendations:
   Custom Fixtures: Create reusable test fixtures
   Test Context: Implement a test context for sharing state
   Retry Mechanism: Add retry logic for flaky tests
4. Improve Test Reporting and Debugging
   Current State:
   Basic test execution output
   Recommendations:
   HTML Reports: Configure HTML reporting
   Video/Screenshot on Failure: Capture visual evidence
   Test Metadata: Add metadata for better reporting
5. Parallel Execution and Test Selection
   Current State:
   Basic test running with workspace support
   Affected tests detection
   Recommendations:
   Tag-based Execution: Enhance test selection
   Test Prioritization: Implement prioritization
   Distributed Testing: Add support for parallel execution
6. Documentation and Examples
   Current State:
   Limited documentation visible
   Recommendations:
   Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation
   Example Tests: Provide template test files
   Best Practices: Document coding standards
7. CI/CD Integration
   Current State:
   Not fully visible in the codebase
   Recommendations:
   CI Pipeline: Add CI pipeline examples
   Test Result Publishing: Publish test results
   Test Environment Management: Automate environment setup
